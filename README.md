# Easiest_FlappyBird
This is the easiest flappy bird game using pygame python

hello folks if you are looking for the flappy bird game then yes you are in a right place this ,i have coded the easiest flappy bird game of just 150 line

So lets breakdown the code

1.our initial step in making this is importing all the necessary modules for the game which are:pygame ,random,math 

2.after that our task will be to prepare a window or screen for our game to run 

3.after that do the necessary imports such as image, audio and all the other things that are required:such as bird image ,audios 

4.in making of flappy bird there is a important concept of gravity  which  you have to apply for making the bird fly or jump: see code for refrence

5.after that check the border condtion that is if the bird is out of boundary or not if bird is out of boundary then game over

6.now you have to create the pipes 

7.one of the most challenging part of the game is displaying the pipes in random order in both up and down side here you have to give some time 
            
8.now check for the collision of bird with the pipes which is an eassy task which you can do it using :pygame.sprite.spritecollideany(player, pipe_sprites)

9.game is over ! -> i have added comment on each section of code explaining what it do 

10.my code is not very good and there many scope in improvement in it if any body like to commit some changes they are free to  do it and please someone correct my display_score logic i have commented it .
